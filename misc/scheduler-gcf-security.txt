In this lab we see how cloud scheduler can invoke a cloud function.

Component-1: Cloud Function
===========================
Write a cloud function to rename the file with a timestamp in the end in the filename like this
pk.txt 
pk.txt.01132021 [the appended string is the date in the format DDMMYYYY ]
capture the url to invoke the cloud function

Component-2: Cloud Scheduler
============================
Create a cloud scheduler and schedule it to run once every minute with 5 stars * * * * * 
Specify the http url of cloud function to be executed every minute.
Now, invoke the cloud scheduler, you will see that the result as FAILED !!! 

Component-3: Fix the failure of cloud scheduler invoking cloud function and secure it with OIDC 
=================================================================================================
Create a service account under IAM section called cf-invoke and specify the role "Cloud Function Invoker" 
Now, specify the cf-invoke service account in the cloud scheduler.  This will enable cloud scheduler to invoke the cloud function successfully.
Also, in the Auth specify "OIDC Connect" ie open Id connect that will help to exchange the tokens automatically between cloud scheduler and cloud function.
