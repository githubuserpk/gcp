Cloud functions example from codelabs:
=======================================


Main link: 
https://developers.google.com/learn/topics/python
Pick up the lab: HTTP Cloud Functions in Python

direct link: 
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-functions-python-http?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.google.com%2Flearn%2Ftopics%2Fpython#7

step-01: setup

In this step, we setup the requirements.  run below command to enable 
cloud functions and cloud build.  We need cloud build because, when 
we run gcloud function deploy command, it invokes cloud build to create
a container image: 

> gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com


step-02: download code from github
===================================

Note: the codelabs asks you to download master.zip, but there is no 
master.zip, they have to update the documentation 

The below 2 steps dont work, so please move to below alternative: 

curl -LO https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip 

alternative: 

from gcloud cmd line do this: 
> git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

Note: This will get you the entire repository, but we need only the 
codelabs/python_powered folder, so move codelabs/ ../ and rm -rf python-docs-samples as it is 70 mb in size as of 16-dec-2021

step-03: deploy the hello_world sample
======================================
gcloud functions deploy hello_world \
  --runtime python38 \
  --trigger-http \
  --allow-unauthenticated

next, get the url and run it from curl 
=========================================
URL=$(gcloud functions describe hello_world --format "value(httpsTrigger.url)")

curl -w "\n" $URL

output: 
Hello World!

There are 2 more gcfs, see in cleanup step below to get the names


step-04: cleanup
=================
gcloud functions delete hello_world --quiet
gcloud functions delete hello_name --quiet
gcloud functions delete python_powered --quiet

No, installation of python38 or nothing was required.  It just ran as is!
no python23 to python3.x conversion, venv etc was required !!!
